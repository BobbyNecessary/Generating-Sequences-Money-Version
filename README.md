Want to know how many ways you can make change? Try this program.

I was asked to build this program during a programming test which I failed (at least I felt I failed) because I could not figure out how to get this working. After some reading, stubborness, and a good nap I knocked this problem out.

This program is very simple and prints to console. Originally it was to tell the user how many combinations of dollars, half dollars, quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies can be made to make 5 dollars, but once I understood the logic I made it a bit more dynamic. Now the program will ask the user what value in cents that they would like to know combination exist.

For myself, if I ever get a problem like that again, I know I can come back to this program. For you, feel free to copy and paste this bad boy if you get it in programming test or something. Just remember me if this gets you the job and good luck!
